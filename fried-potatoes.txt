How to Make It
Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy, nonstick skillet or electric skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and saute until the onion is tender and translucent. Add the red bell pepper and garlic and cook for 1 minute longer.
Add the diced potatoes, paprika, about 1/2 teaspoon salt, along with the freshly ground black pepper. Cover the pan and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until potatoes are just tender. Uncover and increase the heat to medium-high. Continue cooking for about 8 to 10 minutes, occasionally turning, until the potatoes are golden brown.
Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt, if needed.
